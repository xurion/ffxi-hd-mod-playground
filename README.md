# FFXI HD zone mod playground

Having taken inspiration from [Amelila's FFXI HD Overhaul](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKJ4a33wIHWadqXW7SP87aQ), I set up this playground after following his [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpA_RzFulAs) on the basics of FFXI modding. Thanks Dave :D

## Structure

Each zone I've modded follows the same structure as the DATs in the FFXI installation directory. For example, the Marjami Ravine zone dat is located in ROM9/0/13.dat. Here, ROM9/0/13 - Marjami Ravine is a directory that contains the textures and the modified DAT file.

## Zones

* Marjami Ravine - ROM9/0/13
